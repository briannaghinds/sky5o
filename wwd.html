        <h1><b>What We Do</b></h1>
        <p> <br> High speed chases can result in property damage, civilian injuries, and at some times civililan death. If a chase happens, whenever a suspect is fleeing the scene and is said to be a danger to civilians or is a threat to themselves the police will call off the chase, this is known as a "no chase" policy. A situation like this is where our technology can be deployed to aid in the situation. <br> <br> In cases of  “no chase” policies, the use of drones allows the chase to continue without putting any civilians at risk, and having an aerial view of the vehicle at large gives the officers a better line of sight than those on the ground if a suspect were ever to go off-road or in a narrow back alleyway. Drones are also a very inexpensive resource any and all police and sheriff departments can use because not every facility has a helicopter on standby. <br> <br> Our program has two modes that offers a range of assistance. Our first mode is <i>manual mode</i>, where the drone can be deployed and controlled via the keyboard. Our second mode is <i>convert license plate</i>, which uses the drone's camera to capture (through a key press) a license plate of the vehicle and transfers the image to a string, for the police to have in their database.</p>
