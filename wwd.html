        <h1><b>What We Do</b></h1>
        <p> <br> High speed chases can result in property damage, civilian injuries, and at some times civililan death. If a chase happens, whenever a suspect is fleeing the scene and is said to be a danger to civilians or is a threat to themselves the police will call of the chase, this is known as a "no chase" policy. This is when our technology can be deployed to aid in these situations. <br> <br> Our program has two modes that offers a range of assistance. Our first mode is <i>manual mode</i>, where the drone can be deployed and controlled via the keyboard. Our second mode is <i>convert license plate</i>, which uses the drone's camera to capture (through a key press) a license plate of the vehicle and transfers the image to a string, for the police to have in their database.</p>
